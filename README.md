# CompilerDesign-Questions
This repository contains a collection of Compiler Design Programs, implemented in both C and Lex, to demonstrate core concepts and techniques in compiler construction. The repository is a comprehensive resource for understanding and practicing compiler design methodologies.

## Contents:
### i) C Programs:
Programs focus on various compilation stages, such as intermediate code generation, code optimization, and machine-level instruction generation.
Includes a C program for converting expressions into postfix form and generating optimized code, complete with a quadratic table and machine-level instructions.

### ii) Lex Programs:
Examples showcasing the use of Lex for lexical analysis.
Automates token recognition, forming the foundation for parser integration.

## Highlights:
Designed for students and professionals learning Compiler Design.
Includes easy-to-understand code with concise comments for educational purposes.
Focus on real-world examples like code optimization and intermediate code generation.
